This is a guide on how to play my game. Refer to it as you are playing.
If you have no idea how poker works, I suggest reading an article on WikiHow or somethnig and learning to play the game first before coming here.

Starting the game:
- At first the game will ask for the number of players. This can be anywhere from 2 - 8. You can play with more than 2 people if you want to, but there is no AI so you will have to play for them.

- Then you will provide the buy-in, which is the amount of money everyone starts with initially. This can be any (reasonable) amount above $5.

- Then you have to enter the amount of the minimum bet. At the beginning of each round, the small blind has to put half of this amount and the big blind has to put the entire amount. You can also enter $0 if you want to play without blinds.

- Lastly, you will provide a name for each player. The name is what the computer will use to refer to you during each turn.

Playing a round:
- When your turn starts, the computer will display the amount of money in the pot, the bet you have to call (if any) and the amount of money you currently have.

- You will be asked if you want to see your cards or not. Generally in poker since you only have two cards you won’t need to look at them all the time. 
This is also sort of a security measure since everyone shares the same screen. Make sure to hide the screen when you reveal your cards.

- During the first turn only, if you are one of the 2 people immediately after the dealer, you will be a blind.(This only applies if you chose to play with blinds)
If you are immediately after the dealer, you are the small blind, meaning you have to put half the amount of the minimum bet. You can choose to call the rest of the way to the minimum bet the next turn.
The next person is the big blind, and they have to complete the minimum bet by raising the remaining half. They will place down the entire amount of the minimum.
The computer places the bets automatically and ends the turn. 

- The game will the remaining players to call (or check if nothing to call), raise, or fold. 
(read the WikiHow if you don’t know what these are). 
Calling will automatically match the previous bet. You do not need to enter any input.
If you raise, you will be asked for the amount you want to add. Note, raising the previous bet will automatically call it. For example, if the previous bet is $1 and you raise by $2, you will be putting down a total of $3.
If you choose to fold, you will go out of the game for the round and your cards will not be evaluated. You will still be dealt in the next round.
If the last bet is more than you have, you can either go all in or fold. Going all in will place the remainder of your chips and will exempt you from betting for the rest of the round. 

- After choosing your play, you can press enter wherever you are ready to end your turn. This will print a bunch of spaces and will hide your screen from the next player. Pass the computer to the next person and allow them to make their play.

- After all the bets have been matched, the game places down 3 community cards in the “flop” and everyone takes turns again, same as before. 
- This repeats two more times with the computer placing down one card in the flop each time. By the end, you will have your two original cards along with 5 other community cards in the flop.

Ending the round:
- After everyone has matched bets, each player will have to pick 5 cards out of the seven cards they have available to them. 

- The computer will show you all the cards you can choose along with numbers next to them. 
- Type the corresponding numbers in sequence separated by commas only. Please enter only 5 numbers and ensure they are between 1 and 7. This particular input field is a bit delicate and it doesn’t handle all bad inputs. So be careful.

- After everyone has chosen their cards, the game will evaluate each hand and print out what each player had. 
- Then the computer looks through each hand and determines who has the highest hand ranking. If one person has the highest ranking, they win the pot.
- If there is a tie in rankings, the computer looks at the highest card among the players’ hands. The person with the highest card is the winner and gets the pot.
If multiple people have the same rankings and the same high card, they will tie as winners, and the pot will be equally split between them.

- The round will also end if all but one people fold during betting. Cards will not be revealed and the hands will not be evaluated. The person who remains is automatically the winner.

- After each round, the game displays how much money each player has. If you had gone all in and you are out of money, you bust out and are permanently out of the game. 
- The game ends when everyone except one person has busted out.
